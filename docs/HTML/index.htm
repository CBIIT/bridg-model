<h3> BRIDG: An international standard for biomedical research concepts designed to support computable semantic
interoperability </h3>

<H2> BRIDG Goals and Mission </H2>
<P>The goal of the BRIDG Project is to produce a shared view of the semantics of a common domain-of-interest, specifically the domain of basic, pre-clinical, clinical, and translational research and its associated regulatory artifacts.

<P>The mission of BRIDG is to enable computable semantic interoperability (CSI), the ability for information systems to exchange, at a machine-to-machine level, the meaning (rather than simply the structure) of data and/or to effectively combine functionality across machine/system boundaries. A shared semantic view is essential if the clinical research community, both for itself and also as part of the larger healthcare and life sciences communities, is to achieve CSI in the various data interchanges and application interactions between systems.

<P>This shared view can be used to:
<UL>
  <LI>document information requirements before designing and building a solution.
  <LI>build the information structures in the solution.
  <LI>trace requirements throughout the solution development process.
</UL>
<P>In BRIDG, this shared view is expressed as a collection of visual diagrams using the iconography and grammar of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). This set of visual diagrams plus the underlying relationships, definitions, explanations, and examples are collectively referred to as the BRIDG Model. For a short introduction to UML, please see the BRIDG User Guide that is published with each release of the model.
<h3>BRIDG as a Reference Model</h3>
  <P>BRIDG can be used as a source for clinical research data semantics and/or a foundation model to develop a consistent set of concepts representing the domain of translational research, to facilitate semantic agreement between different stakeholders in a joint project, to validate requirements for a system so that subject matter experts, analysts and implementers share a common view, to communicate ideas clearly about function and data use.

<h3>BRIDG as a Data Integration/Mapping Solution</h3>
<P>As a data integration or mapping solution, BRIDG can serve as the hub, where many different standards or models, the spokes, are mapped to a single point (BRIDG, the hub) and can be translated into any of the other spokes without having to do many different point to point mappings. Such a solution is also extensible in that new BRIDG-based mappings can be added as time goes on without having to redo a myriad of additional point to point mappings.

<h3>BRIDG as an Exchange Format</h3>
<P>At the transactional level or at a data set level, BRIDG can be used as a data exchange format, where subsets of BRIDG classes representing related concepts are exchanged in XSD/XML format.

<h3>BRIDG-Based Physical Database</h3>
<P>As a conceptual model, BRIDG can be used to create logical and physical database models in support of clinical research software solutions. Numerous institutions, including NMDP, Thomas Jefferson University, a large CRO, FDA, and others have used this approach both at the prototype and production levels.

<h3>BRIDG as an Ontology</h3>
<P>As a network of well-defined terms, BRIDG can serve as a resource for developing a clinical or translational research ontology. Many of BRIDGâ€™s robust definitions have previously been converted into an OWL representation on a few occasions, subsequently bringing to light issues that have been addressed to make the UML model more consistent.
