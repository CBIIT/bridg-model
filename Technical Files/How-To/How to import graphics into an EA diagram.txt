1. Add a note to the diagram
2. Right click on the note > Appearance > Select Alternate Image > Add New…
3. Then select the image using the browser – note that long file names seem to be a problem (give a misleading message saying it’s the wrong file type) so I just used 8 character file names with no spaces to be safe
4. Just say OK when it asks you to specify the name of the file.
5. The file will then appear in the list and should be selected already and displayed in the preview (thumbnail) window
6. Click OK
7. Resize the image as needed (e.g. to fit on a portrait or landscape page) because it imports them LARGE!
