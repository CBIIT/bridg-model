READ ME BEFORE RUNNING THESE QUERIES:

Note that either of these queries will need to be updated if more sub-domain packages are added.
Also if a different diagram is used as the comprehensive diagram you're comparing against, you'll have to updated the diagram_id value.


Classes in the comprehensive diagram that are not in the official packages:

select t_object.name, t_object.object_id
from t_object inner join t_diagramObjects on t_diagramObjects.object_id = t_object.object_id
where t_object.object_id not in
(Select t_object2.object_id
from t_object as t_object2 
where t_object2.package_id in (574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 612, 613, 614)
and t_object2.object_type = "Class"
)
and   t_diagramObjects.diagram_id = 963
and   t_object.object_type = "Class"
order by 1
